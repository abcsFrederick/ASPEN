# Running ASPEN

To effectively run the ASPEN (ATAC-Seq PipEliNe) on the Biowulf High-Performance Computing (HPC) system, please follow the detailed user guide below:

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Biowulf Account:** Ensure you have an active Biowulf account.
- **Data Preparation:** Store your raw ATAC-Seq paired-end FASTQ files in a directory accessible from Biowulf.

## 🌐 Setting Up the Environment

### 🚀 Load the ASPEN Module on Biowulf

To access ASPEN, load the `ccbrpipeliner` module:

```bash
module load ccbrpipeliner/8
```

This command adds aspen to your system's PATH, allowing you to execute pipeline commands directly.

> **Note**: If you're operating outside of Biowulf, ensure that dependencies such as snakemake, python, and singularity are installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

### 📝 Create a Sample Manifest

ASPEN requires a sample manifest file (`samples.tsv`) to identify and organize your input data. This tab-separated file should include the following columns:

- `replicateName`: A unique name for each **biological replicate** — i.e. each independently processed biological sample (separate cell culture, animal, or patient). Every row must have a distinct value.
- `sampleName`: The condition or group label shared by all biological replicates from the same experimental group (e.g. `CONTROL` or `TREATMENT`). Multiple rows will share the same `sampleName`.
- `path_to_R1_fastq`: Absolute path to the Read 1 FASTQ file.
- `path_to_R2_fastq`: Absolute path to the Read 2 FASTQ file (required for paired-end data).

!!! note
    Symlinks for R1 and R2 files will be created in the results directory, named as `<replicateName>.R1.fastq.gz` and `<replicateName>.R2.fastq.gz`, respectively. Therefore, original filenames do not need to be altered.

!!! note
    The `replicateName` is used as a prefix for individual peak calls, while the `sampleName` serves as a prefix for consensus peak calls.

!!! warning "Biological vs. technical replicates"
    ASPEN expects **one row per biological replicate**. If you sequenced the same sample across multiple lanes or sequencing runs (technical replicates), you must **concatenate those FASTQ files into a single file** before creating your manifest — ASPEN does not merge lanes internally.

    Biological replicates are independent samples:

    - **Biological**: independent biological samples (separate cultures, animals, patients, etc.). Use one row per sample in `samples.tsv`.
    - **Technical**: the same sample re-sequenced across multiple lanes or runs. `cat` the FASTQs together first, then use one row.

    Example of concatenating technical replicates before running ASPEN:

    ```bash
    cat sample1_L001_R1.fastq.gz sample1_L002_R1.fastq.gz > sample1_R1.fastq.gz
    cat sample1_L001_R2.fastq.gz sample1_L002_R2.fastq.gz > sample1_R2.fastq.gz
    ```

    DESeq2 (used in `diffatac`) requires **at least 2 biological replicates per group**. Technical replicates do not count as biological replicates and will not satisfy this requirement.

!!! note
    For differential ATAC analysis, create a `contrasts.tsv` file with two columns (Group1 and Group2 ... aka Sample1 and Sample2, without headers) and place it in the output directory after initialization. Ensure each group/sample in the contrast has at least two biological replicates, as DESeq2 requires this for accurate contrast calculations.

## 🏃 Running the ASPEN Pipeline

ASPEN operates through a series of modes to facilitate various stages of the analysis.

### 🗂️ Initialize the Working Directory

Begin by initializing your working directory, which will house configuration files and results. Replace <path_to_output_folder> with your desired output directory path:

```bash
aspen -m=init -w=<path_to_output_folder>
```

This command generates a config.yaml and a placeholder `samples.tsv` in the specified directory. Edit these files to reflect your experimental setup, replacing the placeholder `samples.tsv` with your prepared manifest. If performing differential analysis, include the `contrasts.tsv` file at this stage.

!!! note
    To explore all possible options of the `aspen` command you can either run it without any arguments or run `aspen --help`

Here is what help looks like:

!!! note
    This is illustrative example output captured at doc-writing time — exact values (e.g. `pipeline_home`, `git commit/tag`, `aspen_version`) will differ depending on which ASPEN version/branch is installed at your site. Run `aspen --help` yourself to see the current values for your installation.

### ⚙️ Configurational Changes

#### MACS2

MACS2 parameters can be changed by editing this block in the `config.yaml`:

```yaml
macs2:
    extsize: 200
    shiftsize: 100
    p: 0.01
    qfilter: 0.05
    annotatePeaks: True
```

#### Genrich

Genrich parameters can be changed by editing this block in the `config.yaml`:

```yaml
genrich:
    s: 5
    m: 6
    q: 1
    l: 100
    g: 100
    d: 100
    qfilter: 0.05
    annotatePeaks: True
```

#### Contrasts

If contrasts are to be calculated then fixed-width peaks are used with the following changeable options:

```yaml
# peak fixed width
fixed_width: 500

# contrasts info
contrasts: "WORKDIR/contrasts.tsv"
contrasts_fc_cutoff: 2
contrasts_fdr_cutoff: 0.05
```

### 🧬 Enabling Spike-In Normalization (Optional)

ASPEN supports spike-in normalization, which is useful for controlling technical variability or comparing global shifts in chromatin accessibility across samples. Spike-in reads (e.g., from _Drosophila melanogaster_ or _E. coli_) are aligned separately and used to compute normalization factors that are applied to host genome accessibility counts.

Not sure whether you need this for your experiment? See ["Should I turn on spike-in normalization?"](overview.md#optional-spike-in-normalization) in the Overview docs for a decision guide.

To enable spike-in normalization, edit the `config.yaml` file that was generated during `init`. You can find it in your output directory (`<path_to_output_folder>/config.yaml`).

Open the file and locate the following lines:

<pre><code>spikein: False
# spikein: True

spikein_genome: "dmelr6.32" # Drosophila mel.
# spikein_genome: "ecoli_k12" # E. coli
</code></pre>

To activate spike-in normalization:

1. Set `spikein` to `True`
2. Uncomment or change the `spikein_genome` to match your experiment

#### 📝 Example Configuration

For _Drosophila_ spike-in:

<pre><code>spikein: True
spikein_genome: "dmelr6.32"
</code></pre>

For _E. coli_ spike-in:

<pre><code>spikein: True
spikein_genome: "ecoli_k12"
</code></pre>

> **Note**: The spike-in genome must be pre-indexed and available in the reference directory used by ASPEN. Please contact the pipeline maintainers if you need to add a new spike-in genome.

Once enabled, ASPEN will:

- Align reads to both the host and spike-in genomes.
- Quantify spike-in counts per sample.
- Normalize accessibility counts using spike-in-derived scaling factors.
- Report both normalized and raw counts in the output tables and reports.

### 🛠️ Dry Run the Pipeline

Before executing the full analysis and after editing the `config.yaml` as needed, perform a dry run to visualize the workflow and identify potential issues:

```bash
aspen -m=dryrun -w=<path_to_output_folder>
```

#### What successful dry-run output looks like

![Example ASPEN dry-run console output](assets/images/aspen_dryrun_console.jpeg)

The dry-run summary confirms that ASPEN finished the preflight checks successfully, points you to `dryrun.log` for the full transcript, and ends with the exact `run` command to use next.

In practice, the wrapper prefixes mean:

- `STEP` starts a major wrapper phase.
- `OK` confirms that phase completed successfully.
- `INFO` reports status details such as where output was written.
- `NEXT` gives the follow-up command or monitoring action ASPEN expects you to take.

For `dryrun`, the short terminal summary is only the high-level result. The full dry-run transcript is written to `dryrun.log`; see the [outputs page](outputs.md) for the complete workdir artifact reference.

This step outlines the sequence of tasks (Directed Acyclic Graph - DAG) without actual execution, allowing you to verify the planned operations.

### 🚀 Execute the Pipeline

If the dry run output is satisfactory, proceed to execute the pipeline:

```bash
aspen -m=run -w=<path_to_output_folder>
```

#### What successful run submission output looks like

![Example ASPEN run submission console output](assets/images/aspen_run_console.jpeg)

The run summary shows that ASPEN created the submission script, wrote the `pipeline.running` marker updates during submission, and printed the `NEXT` monitoring hints for `squeue`, `snakemake.log`, and `pipeline.status.json`.

Those lines map directly to files in `WORKDIR`:

- `submit_script.sbatch` is created before the master Slurm job is submitted.
- `pipeline.running` is the human-readable status marker updated during execution.
- `pipeline.status.json` is the machine-readable sidecar for scripting and automation.
- `snakemake.log` is the detailed workflow execution log once the run starts.

Treat the `NEXT` lines as the wrapper's built-in "what should I do now?" guidance. They point you to the same files and commands documented below and in the [outputs page](outputs.md), without requiring you to remember the monitoring commands yourself.

This command submits a master job to the Slurm workload manager, which orchestrates the entire analysis workflow, managing job submissions and monitoring progress.

ASPEN submits the generated Snakemake job with rule-level resources exposed to Slurm. The heavy rules that may need extra scratch space now define an attempt-aware `resources.gres` value, so the first submission uses the baseline `cluster.json` request and later retries can scale the requested `lscratch` allocation automatically if a rule is retried by Snakemake. This keeps the default configuration in `cluster.json` while still allowing individual rules to become more conservative on repeated failures.

- 🛠️ **Optional Argument**:

`--singcache` or `-c`: Override the Singularity cache directory. On Biowulf, when you load the `ccbrpipeliner` module, ASPEN already uses `SIFCACHE=/data/CCBR_Pipeliner/SIFS` for you, so you usually do not need `-c`. Use `-c` only on another HPC system if you want to point ASPEN at your own cache directory or pull containers yourself.

**💡 Example Command**:

```bash
aspen -m=run -w=<path_to_output_folder> -c /data/${USER}/.singularity
```

This example is for a non-Biowulf HPC system where you want to manage your own Singularity cache location.

## 📊 Monitor ASPEN Runs

For day-to-day status checks, use the sidecar and `pipeline.*` files below first. They are the fastest and most reliable way to see whether ASPEN is running, completed, or failed. Reach for `squeue` and `scontrol` only when you want an advanced scheduler-level view or need to inspect an individual SLURM job.

If you do need to inspect the cluster directly, `squeue` shows the queue state and `scontrol` exposes detailed job metadata.

### 📝 Pipeline State Markers: the primary status check

ASPEN writes a set of state-tracking files directly into `WORKDIR` while a `run` is executing, so you can check status from the sidecar and `pipeline.*` files first, even without Slurm access (for example, from a laptop over `ssh`):

- `pipeline.running`, `pipeline.completed`, `pipeline.failed`, `pipeline.canceled` — exactly one of these marker files exists at a time, reflecting the current state. While the pipeline is running, `pipeline.running` is periodically refreshed by a background progress monitor with a human-readable summary, including the percentage of Snakemake steps completed so far:

    ```bash
    cat <path_to_output_folder>/pipeline.running
    ```

- `pipeline.status.json` — a machine-readable sidecar with the same information (`state`, `reason`, `slurm_job_id`, start/end timestamps, `duration_seconds`, `tasks_done`/`tasks_total`, `exit_code`), useful for scripting/automation:

    ```bash
    cat <path_to_output_folder>/pipeline.status.json
    ```

- `snakemake.log.jobby` / `snakemake.log.jobby.short` — a `jobby` TSV summary of per-rule/job resource usage, generated as a best-effort step after the run finishes (even if the Slurm submission itself failed before Snakemake started).

To view all your active and pending jobs, execute:

```bash
squeue -u $USER --format="%.18i %.30j %.11P %.15T %.10r %.10M %.10l %.5D %.5C %.10m %.25b %.8N" --sort=-S
```

This command lists all jobs submitted by your user account, displaying details such as job IDs, partitions, job names, user names, job states, and the nodes allocated.

For more granular information about a specific job, including its child jobs spawned by ASPEN, use the scontrol command:

```bash
scontrol show job <jobid>
```

Replace <jobid> with the specific Job ID of interest. This will provide comprehensive details about the job's configuration and status, aiding in effective monitoring and management of your ASPEN pipeline processes.

To quickly gauge the process of the entire pipeline run:

```bash
grep "done$" <path_to_output_folder>/snakemake.log
```
