| alignment     | qsortedBam          | - Query sorted Bowtie2 alignments in BAM format. <br> - Excludes unmapped and platform/vendor quality failing reads. <br> - Used for Genrich peak calling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| alignment     | filteredBam         | - Filtered BAM files after excluding non-primary, supplementary, and MAPQ <=5 alignments. <br> - This is the `nondedup` BAM (i.e. before duplicate removal) used for the `nondedup` counts/DiffATAC variant. <br> - Derived from `qsortedBam`.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| alignment     | dedupBam            | - Deduplicated filtered BAM files (PCR/optical duplicates marked with PicardTools and excluded). <br> - Derived from `filteredBam`. <br> - Used for MACS2 peak calling, FRiP, and the recommended `dedup` counts/DiffATAC variant. <br> - Can also be used downstream with CCBR_TOBIAS pipeline.                                                                                                                          |

| peaks         | genrich & macs      | - Genrich/MACS2 peak calls (raw, consensus, fixed-width). <br> - Contains ROI files with Diff-ATAC results if `contrasts.tsv` is provided. <br> - Calculated with DESeq2 using both read counts and tn5 nicking sites in ROI. <br> - Counts matrices and DiffATAC results are generated separately for `dedup` (PCR duplicates removed, recommended) and `nondedup` (duplicates retained) BAMs, in like-named subfolders. |
| visualization | dedup / nondedup    | - Tn5 nicking-site/read BAMs, BEDs, and bigwigs, split into `dedup` and `nondedup` subfolders depending on whether PCR duplicates were removed from the source BAM before generating them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

#### How consensus peaks are generated

**Why two rounds?** A single replicate's peak calls are noisy — some "peaks"
are just sequencing/technical artifacts that happened to occur in one
replicate. Pooling and filtering peaks _within_ a sample (Round 1) gives a
reproducibility-checked, per-sample truth set. But differential accessibility
testing needs to compare counts _across_ samples/conditions, which requires
one shared set of regions measured identically everywhere — a per-sample
peak set alone doesn't give you that. Round 2 solves this by merging the
per-sample consensus peaks into a single, fixed-width Region of Interest
(ROI) set shared by every sample, so the same coordinates can be quantified
and compared across the whole experiment.

ASPEN produces peaks at two levels of consensus. Understanding the distinction is
important for interpreting output files and configuring the pipeline correctly.

ASPEN generates three related-but-distinct peak representations, not three
competing choices: `pooled.narrowPeak` (diagnostic — how many peaks exist in
the pooled replicate data, before requiring individual-replicate
reproducibility), `consensus.bed` (Round 1 — variable-width,
reproducibility-filtered peaks per sample, useful for peak annotation and for
comparing against other pipelines' conventional peak outputs), and the
`fixed_width` consensus (Round 2 — same width for every ROI, specifically so
that read/Tn5 counts and DESeq2 differential testing aren't confounded by
peak-length differences or broken by daisy-chained merges across many
samples). **Use the fixed-width ROI set for differential accessibility
testing; use `consensus.bed`/`pooled.narrowPeak` for peak annotation, QC, or
cross-pipeline comparison.**

**Round 1 — Per-sample consensus** (`*.macs2.consensus.bed` / `*.genrich.consensus.bed`)

> _"Which peaks are reproducible across biological replicates of the same sample?"_

1. All replicate tagAlign files for a sample are **pooled** and passed to MACS2/Genrich together → produces a large set of candidate peaks from the pooled data.
2. Each candidate peak is checked for overlap with peaks called in each **individual replicate**.
3. A peak is retained in the consensus only if it overlaps peaks in **≥ `consensus_min_replicates`** replicates (default: 2, meaning present in at least 2 replicates). Adjust `consensus_min_replicates` in `config.yaml` to make this filter stricter.

```
replicate 1 peaks ─┐
replicate 2 peaks ─┼─► pooled peaks ─► overlap filter ─► sample.consensus.bed
replicate 3 peaks ─┘                    (≥ min_replicates)
```

**Round 2 — ROI consensus** (`ROI.macs2.bed` / `ROI.genrich.bed`)

> _"Across ALL samples, what is the unified set of fixed-width windows for differential accessibility analysis?"_

1. Per-sample consensus peaks are converted to **fixed-width windows** (default: 500 bp, centered on the peak summit) using the method from [Corces et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4396). Window width is controlled by `fixed_width` in `config.yaml`.
2. Each fixed-width peak is additionally required to overlap peaks in **≥ `roi_min_replicates`** samples/replicates (default: 1) and to meet the **`roi_min_spm`** signal-per-million threshold (default: 2) — analogous to, but independent from, the Round 1 `consensus_min_*` filters above. Adjust `roi_min_replicates`/`roi_min_spm` in `config.yaml` to change how strict this cross-sample filter is.
3. Fixed-width peaks passing that filter are **merged** → `ROI.macs2.bed` — the master set of regions used for DESeq2 read counting and differential accessibility analysis.
4. P-values across the fixed-width consensus are re-normalized (`*.renormalized.fixed_width.consensus.narrowPeak`) to account for the pooling.

```
sample1.consensus.bed ─► fixed-width peaks ─┐
sample2.consensus.bed ─► fixed-width peaks ─┼─► merge ─► ROI.bed ─► DESeq2
sample3.consensus.bed ─► fixed-width peaks ─┘
```

#### Counts matrices: reads vs Tn5 nicking sites, and `dedup` vs `nondedup`

Once the ROIs are established, ASPEN generates two distinct count matrices:

- **Tn5 Nicking Sites Count Matrix**: This matrix quantifies the frequency of Tn5 transposase insertion events at each ROI. The number of insertion events serves as a proxy for chromatin accessibility, since Tn5 transposase preferentially inserts into accessible regions of the chromatin. By counting these insertion sites, researchers can accurately infer the openness of chromatin regions under different experimental conditions.

- **Read Counts Matrix**: This matrix records the number of sequencing reads mapped to each ROI. While Tn5 nicking sites provide a more direct measure of chromatin accessibility, read counts are included in ASPEN as they have been widely used in recent publications. Analyzing both matrices together offers a comprehensive view of chromatin accessibility dynamics.

Both count matrices (and the corresponding DiffATAC/DESeq2 results) are generated **twice** — once from `dedup.bam` (PCR/optical duplicates removed) and once from `filtered.bam` (quality-filtered, duplicates retained, labeled `nondedup`) — under separate `dedup`/`nondedup` output folders (see the folder tree above). Previously only the duplicate-retaining `filtered.bam` was used, which was inconsistent with how MACS2 peaks are called (from `dedup.bam`-derived `tagAlign.gz`) and how FRiP is computed (also from `dedup.bam`).

**Recommendation: use the `dedup` counts/DiffATAC results for standard differential accessibility analysis.** PCR duplication rate varies across samples (input amount, PCR cycles, library complexity), and this variability is not corrected by DESeq2/edgeR size factors — leaving duplicates in can confound differential calls. This also matches standard ATAC-seq practice (e.g. the ENCODE ATAC-seq pipeline, ArchR, Signac).

The `nondedup` outputs are retained for comparison/legacy reasons, with one caveat worth knowing: because Tn5 preferentially inserts into a limited set of highly accessible positions, independent DNA molecules can genuinely land on the same insertion coordinate at very open/narrow sites, and naive deduplication can occasionally discard some true (non-PCR) signal there. Picard's paired-end duplicate definition (which requires _both_ fragment ends to match, not just one nick site) substantially — though not perfectly — mitigates this. If you suspect this is affecting your data, cross-check the per-replicate NRF/PBC (`QC/preseq`) library-complexity metrics: unexpectedly high duplication despite high library complexity points to this effect rather than true PCR over-amplification.

#### Peak Annotation folder

This folder will contain ChIPseeker results for:

- individual replicate `*.narrowPeak` files
- `*.consensus.bed` files
- `*.fixed_width.consensus.narrowPeak` files

The `QC` folder contains the `multiqc_report.html` file which provides a comprehensive summary of the quality control metrics across all samples, including read quality, duplication rates, and other relevant statistics. This report aggregates results from various QC tools such as FastQC, FastqScreen, FLD, TSS enrichment, Peak Annotations, and others, presenting them in an easy-to-read format with interactive plots and tables. It helps in quickly identifying any issues with the sequencing data and ensures that the data quality is sufficient for downstream analysis.

### Genrich output folder

For a typical 2 sample analysis with 2 replicates each this folder should look like very similar to the MACS2 output structure described above.

## `logs` folder

This directory contains all .err and .out log files generated by SLURM for jobs submitted via Snakemake. Each file follows a consistent naming convention:

```bash
<SLURM_JOB_ID of master/head job>.<SLURM_JOB_ID of child job>.<Snakemake Rule Name>.<wildcard1_name=wildcard1_value,wildcard2_name=wildcard2_value>.<out or err>
```

This structure is particularly useful for troubleshooting and debugging, especially when the SLURM job IDs of failed jobs are known. By examining the corresponding .err or .out files, users can efficiently identify the source of errors within specific Snakemake rules and wildcards.
