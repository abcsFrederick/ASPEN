!!! note
BAM files from `dedupBam` can be used for downstream footprinting analysis using [CCBR_TOBIAS](https://github.com/CCBR/CCBR_Tobias) pipeline

!!! note
[bamCompare](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/bamCompare.html) from deeptools can be run to compare BAMs from `dedupBam` for comprehensive BAM comparisons.

!!! note
BAM files from `dedupBam` can also be converted to BED format and processed with [chromVAR](https://github.com/GreenleafLab/chromVAR) to identify variability in motif accessibility across samples and assess differentially active transcription factors from the JASPAR database.

#### How consensus peaks are generated

ASPEN produces peaks at two levels of consensus. Understanding the distinction is
important for interpreting output files and configuring the pipeline correctly.

**Round 1 — Per-sample consensus** (`*.macs2.consensus.bed` / `*.genrich.consensus.bed`)

> _"Which peaks are reproducible across biological replicates of the same sample?"_

1. All replicate tagAlign files for a sample are **pooled** and passed to MACS2/Genrich together → produces a large set of candidate peaks from the pooled data.
2. Each candidate peak is checked for overlap with peaks called in each **individual replicate**.
3. A peak is retained in the consensus only if it overlaps peaks in **≥ `consensus_min_replicates`** replicates (default: 1, meaning present in at least 1 replicate). Adjust `consensus_min_replicates` in `config.yaml` to make this filter stricter.

```
replicate 1 peaks ─┐
replicate 2 peaks ─┼─► pooled peaks ─► overlap filter ─► sample.consensus.bed
replicate 3 peaks ─┘                    (≥ min_replicates)
```

**Round 2 — ROI consensus** (`ROI.macs2.bed` / `ROI.genrich.bed`)

> _"Across ALL samples, what is the unified set of fixed-width windows for differential accessibility analysis?"_

1. Per-sample consensus peaks are converted to **fixed-width windows** (default: 500 bp, centered on the peak summit) using the method from [Corces et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4396). Window width is controlled by `fixed_width` in `config.yaml`.
2. Fixed-width peaks from all samples are **merged** → `ROI.macs2.bed` — the master set of regions used for DESeq2 read counting and differential accessibility analysis.
3. P-values across the fixed-width consensus are re-normalized (`*.renormalized.fixed_width.consensus.narrowPeak`) to account for the pooling.

```
sample1.consensus.bed ─► fixed-width peaks ─┐
sample2.consensus.bed ─► fixed-width peaks ─┼─► merge ─► ROI.bed ─► DESeq2
sample3.consensus.bed ─► fixed-width peaks ─┘
```

#### Peak Annotation folder

This folder will contain ChIPseeker results for:

- individual replicate `*.narrowPeak` files
- `*.consensus.bed` files
- `*.fixed_width.consensus.narrowPeak` files

The `QC` folder contains the `multiqc_report.html` file which provides a comprehensive summary of the quality control metrics across all samples, including read quality, duplication rates, and other relevant statistics. This report aggregates results from various QC tools such as FastQC, FastqScreen, FLD, TSS enrichment, Peak Annotations, and others, presenting them in an easy-to-read format with interactive plots and tables. It helps in quickly identifying any issues with the sequencing data and ensures that the data quality is sufficient for downstream analysis.

### Genrich output folder

For a typical 2 sample analysis with 2 replicates each this folder should look like very similar to the MACS2 output structure described above.

## `logs` folder

This directory contains all .err and .out log files generated by SLURM for jobs submitted via Snakemake. Each file follows a consistent naming convention:

```bash
<SLURM_JOB_ID of master/head job>.<SLURM_JOB_ID of child job>.<Snakemake Rule Name>.<wildcard1_name=wildcard1_value,wildcard2_name=wildcard2_value>.<out or err>
```

This structure is particularly useful for troubleshooting and debugging, especially when the SLURM job IDs of failed jobs are known. By examining the corresponding .err or .out files, users can efficiently identify the source of errors within specific Snakemake rules and wildcards.
